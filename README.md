# Text-as-Data eScience Special Interest Group

## Summary

Text is a ubiquitous and valued data source in the computer and information sciences, many areas of the natural and social sciences, engineering, business and more.  This eScience Special Interest Group is for students, faculty and researchers interested in sharing and learning about UW research and teaching that uses text as data. The groupâ€™s objectives include:
- Promote connections, conversations and collaborations among domains with text-as-data interests on the UW campus
